    <h3 style="text-align: justify;">    A factory or workshop, especially in the clothing industry,
         where manual workers are employed at very low wages for long hours and under poor conditions.
         Even if sweatshop labor is unfair, it is a bad idea to prohibit it. Taking away sweatshops just takes away an option for the poorest workers of the world. While countries can make it illegal for sweatshops to pay low wages, they cannot prevent sweatshops from shutting down and paying no wages. And when that happens, the workers all lose their jobs.
         The 1880s saw a growth in "sweating," as immigrants from eastern and southern Europe flooded central and eastern Europe with cheap labour. Sweatshops started to appear in some areas of Latin America and Asia during the 20th century as industry increased; this trend accelerated with rising consumer demand in the West and the removal of trade barriers.
         Individual employees or teams of employees contract to complete a certain task for a specific sum of money. They sometimes carry out this contract personally, and other times they rent it to less expensive subcontractors. This arrangement may result in irregular employment, poor quality in the finished product, and labour exploitationâ€”often of women, children, and, in industrialised nations, undocumented employees or new immigrants. When business is booming, workers put in incredibly long shifts in dangerously packed workspaces. Subcontractors routinely fire employees without cause when business is slow since their overhead expenses are far lower than those of factory employers. Improving working conditions was one of the earliest goals of factory and minimum wage regulation.
